node-install-script
===================

A script to install basic development tools for node (git, node, gcc, etc)

Works for any recent version of Ubuntu or OS X.

```bash
# Specify the version of node to install
echo "v4.2.3" > /tmp/NODE_VER

# Specify the Github url of your app
echo "https://github.com/<user>/<project>" > /tmp/APP_URL

# And install away!
curl -fsSL bit.ly/easy-install-node | bash
```

**For older versions of Ubuntu**:

```bash
wget -nv bit.ly/easy-install-node -O - | bash
```

This is what gets installed:

* fail2ban (not necessary for development, but should be on every server)
* rsync
* curl
* wget
* git
* xcode / brew / build-essential / pkg-config / gcc
* node
* jshint
* nginx
* forever
